# 🎬 Exploratory Data Analysis on TMDB Movie Dataset

This project is part of the **Data Science Internship – Task 4**, where I performed a detailed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a real-world movie dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata).

## 📁 Dataset Used

- **Name**: TMDB 5000 Movies Dataset

## 🔍 Tasks Performed

### ✅ Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values
- Dropped irrelevant columns
- Converted release dates to datetime
- Extracted release year

### ✅ Descriptive Analysis
- Total number of movies
- Most common genres
- Top 10 highest-rated movies
- Average budget and revenue (excluding zero values)

### ✅ Visualizations
- Bar chart of most common genres
- Pie chart of rating categories (Low, Average, High)
- Line chart of number of movies released per year
- Heatmap of correlations (budget, revenue, rating, popularity)
- Bar plots comparing:
  - Top 10 production companies
  - Movie count by language
  - Average rating by language
